# .txtFileWordFrequencyCounter

**Description**

This program takes in a .txt file as an input and prints out in the console the most common to the least common words that appear in the .txt file along with the number of times that particular word appears.

**Necessary Installations**

Java IDE (preferrably Eclipse)

**Usage**

There are 3 sample .txt files in the Java Project already, but if you wish to add more, you can add it to the Java Project folders and add the following lines in order in the main function:
* Map<String, Integer> words"DESIRED NUMBER" = new HashMap<String, Integer>();
* countEachWord(""FILENAME".txt", words1); //Test Case "DESIRED NUMBER"
* System.out.println(sortByValue(words"DESIRED NUMBER"));

where "DESIRED NUMBER" is the number of the test case you would like to run and "FILENAME" is the name of the .txt file inserted into the Java Project
